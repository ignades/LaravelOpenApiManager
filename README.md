## About LaravelOpenApiManager Author:Ignacio Sebastian Olivieri first version  27/02/2024

To do a best Documentation to work on a team I think 27/02/2024 to start create an application to create very fast the annotations on each Controller of laravel to use with Swagger

- [Swagger-OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

## Requirements

To work with this Pacckage is essential observe rules 

- Use Correct Names of Controllers ans Models this code is based on this logic . 
- Example1 Controller ( ProductsController ) Model (Product) OK
- Example2 Controller ( ProdController ) Model (Products) BAD! 
- You can use Resources Routes and Personal Routes of your Controller, Only in : dir routes/api.php OK

- Artisan Commands : to add Annotations on you controller you nedd use php artisan app:create-swagl5 this generate the Annotations for each Api Method

- Thi documentation and code is under Costruction actually work but need more Parameters this will be do from me ;).
